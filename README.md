# Angular JS + Express JS

Angular JS is an execent Javascript framwork in UI frontend. Express JS is an popular Node.js module in UI backend. 
And it's popular to use them together now. 

So I create this demo, it's an very easy demo to set up an webisite, using Angular JS(1.3.15) in frontend, and Express JS(4.12.1) in backend.

This can help you understand how they works better.


# Libs

## Angular JS Info

HTML is great for declaring static documents, but it falters when we try to use it for declaring dynamic views in web-applications. AngularJS lets you extend HTML vocabulary for your application. The resulting environment is extraordinarily expressive, readable, and quick to develop.

## Express JS Info

Latest Version: 4.12.1.

URL: http://expressjs.com/

Express is a minimal and flexible Node.js web application framework that provides a robust set of features for web and mobile applications.
